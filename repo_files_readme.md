# Description of files:

`DecisionTree.ipynb`: Juypter notebook containing the code for training a decision tree classifier on the images in the training dataset and performing predictions on the images in the test dataset. These images have already been preprocessed.

`Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Juypter notebook for splitting the data into train, test, and validation sets as well was performing image preprocessing such as rotation, brightness adjustment, shear, zoom, and flipping

`CNN.ipynb`: Deep learning image classification using TensorFlow and Keras; we did data preparation with train-validation-test split, exploratory data visualization, data augmentation, CNN model and training, and performance evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics. This file in particular has the results for a 30 epoch run (Adam optimizer).

`CNN_Improved.ipynb`: Deep learning image classification using TensorFlow and Keras; we did data preparation with train-validation-test split, exploratory data visualization, data augmentation, CNN model and training, and performance evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics.  This file in particular has the results for a 30 epoch run and a learning rate of 0.006 (Adam optimizer), along with Top K and speed metrics.

`CNN_50_Epochs.ipynb`: Deep learning image classification using TensorFlow and Keras; we did data preparation with train-validation-test split, exploratory data visualization, data augmentation, CNN model and training, and performance evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics. This file in particular has the results for a 50 epoch run and a learning rate of 0.006 (Adam optimizer), along with Top K and speed metrics.

`fruit_dataset`: Our fruit dataset of fresh and rotten, peaches, strawberries, and pomegranates.

`Initial_Proposal`: Our initial proposal's README.
