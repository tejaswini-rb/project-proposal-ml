- CNNs: This folder contains the vanilla CNN model, EfficientNet, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2 models.  Image classification using TensorFlow and Keras; we did data preparation with train-validation-test split, exploratory data visualization, data augmentation, CNN model and training, and performance evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics.
    - CNN_10_Epochs.ipynb: This file has the results for a 10 epoch run and a default learning rate (Adam optimizer).
    - CNN_30_Epochs.ipynb:  This file has the results for a 30 epoch run and a learning rate of 0.006 (Adam optimizer), along with Top K and speed metrics.
    - CNN_50_Epochs.ipynb: This file has the results for a 50 epoch run and a learning rate of 0.006 (Adam optimizer), along with Top K and speed metrics.
    - CNN_ResNet_MobileNetV2_EfficientNet.ipynb: This file explores the accuracy, top K, and speed of Resnet50, EfficientNet, and MobileNetV2.
